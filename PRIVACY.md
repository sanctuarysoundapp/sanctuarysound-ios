# Privacy Policy — SanctuarySound

**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026

SanctuarySound ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.

## Data Collection

**SanctuarySound collects no personal data.** The App does not transmit any information to external servers, third-party services, or analytics platforms.

## Microphone Access

The App requests microphone access solely for **real-time Sound Pressure Level (SPL) measurement**. Audio data from the microphone is:

- Processed locally on your device in real time
- Used only to calculate decibel levels for the SPL monitoring feature
- **Never recorded, stored, or transmitted** to any server or third party
- Discarded immediately after the SPL reading is computed

You may deny microphone access at any time via iOS Settings. The App will continue to function for all features except SPL monitoring.

## Local Data Storage

All user data (services, vocalist profiles, input presets, mixer snapshots, SPL preferences, and session reports) is stored **locally on your device** in the app's Documents directory as JSON files. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not synced to any cloud service
- Is not accessible to other apps
- Is deleted when you uninstall the App

## In-App Purchases

The App offers a one-time in-app purchase ("SanctuarySound Pro") processed entirely through Apple's App Store. SanctuarySound does not collect, store, or have access to any payment information. All billing is handled by Apple. See [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) for details.

## Third-Party Services

SanctuarySound does **not** integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The App contains no advertising, social features, or data collection mechanisms.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
